# Basic DynamoDB Lambda

This is a lab project that I wrote to see if I could make C#, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB 
work together harmoniously. It's built on top of the bones of a "Hello World" AWS Lambda
project (hence the name.)

I forgot to add a .gitignore file at the beginning, so there's a lot of junk hanging around.
